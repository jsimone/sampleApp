<h2>Comment Text: Basic Code Generator.
 <p>
 The generator will load up all Force.com schema object (SObject) information 
 for a given Force.com store (organization). It then filters and selects
 the data that is necessary for code generation and writes
 this to a {@code Template}.
 <p>
 Notice that code generation is analogous to MVC (well, at
 least the MV parts): 
 <p>
 <ol>
   <li>
    Model = {@code DataFilter}, {@code DataSelector}. This provides the data that will
    be used in the template.
    </li>
    <li>
    View = {@code Template}.  This represents the physical layout of
    the code being generated.
    </li>
    <li>
    A {@code WriterProvider} provides Jave {@code Writer}s to the {@code CodeGenerator}
    to tell it where to write the generated code. 
    </li>
 </ol></h2>

<h3>public generateCode(com.sforce.soap.partner.PartnerConnection)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Generates code based on a connection to a Force.com store (organization).
 <p>
 This will make various Force.com API calls to a Force.com store.  First,
 it will run a global describe.  Next, it will run full describes on the
 global describe results.  These calls will be batched in the most efficient
 way possible (that is, making the least number of Force.com API calls).
 <p>
 The full describe results will be filtered and injected into a {@code Template}
 whose contents will then be written to a Java {@code Writer}.
