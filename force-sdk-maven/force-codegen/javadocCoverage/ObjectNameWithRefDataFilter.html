<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: A {@link DataFilter} which filters based on Force.com schema object (SObject)
 names and follows object references to produce a closed set of schema objects.
 <p>
 This {@code DataFilter} will filter in a Force.com schema object if and only if
 at least one of the two following conditions are met:
 <p>
 <ol>
   <li>Its name exactly matches one in the {@code ObjectNameWithRefDataFilter} state</li>
   <li>It is referenced by a schema object that has already been filtered in</li>
 </ol>
 Names in the {@code ObjectNameWithRefDataFilter} state which match no schema objects are
 ignored.</h2>
