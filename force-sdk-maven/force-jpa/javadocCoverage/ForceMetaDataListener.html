<h3>public loaded(org.datanucleus.metadata.AbstractClassMetaData)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>This method gets called when an entity is loaded during startup. There is
 some basic validation that happens here as well as the caching of objects 
 (a.k.a. @Entity classes).  Registration of fields happens in the {@link ForceMetaDataManager}
