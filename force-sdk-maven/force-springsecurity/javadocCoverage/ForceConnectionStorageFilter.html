<h1>com.force.sdk.springsecurity.ForceConnectionStorageFilter</h1>
<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: This filter should run after all other Force.com filters in the spring security chain. It ensures
 that the connection information of the authenticated user is set into the Force.com Connector
 framework so that it is available to other Force.com SDK frameworks.
 
 It's important that this filter run as the last Force.com Spring Security filter because it is important that
 the connection storage takes place regardless of which authentication method and data storage method
 was used. It's also important that the final result of the entire authentication chain is what gets stored in 
 the connector.
 
 The logic to renew a session is also in this filter. This hook will be called as needed by the Spring Security
 Framework.</h2>

<h3>public renewSession(com.sforce.ws.ConnectorConfig)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>We will renew a session by sending the user into the OAuth flow. A renewal attempt
 results in a runtime exception so that it can either be handled by an application or
 be allowed to bubble up to the servlet filter where the authentication redirect takes place.
