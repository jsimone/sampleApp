<h2>Comment Text: A connector to the Force.com service.
 <p>
 This connector will manage and provide connections to the Force.com service. It can
 provide the following connection types:
 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>PartnerConnection - Used for SOAP API calls</li>
   <li>MetadataConnection - Used for Force.com's Metadata API</li>
   <li>BulkConnection - Used for Force.com's Bulk API</li>
 </ul>
 Connectors require a {@link ForceConnectorConfig} to provide connection
 properties.  They can handle {@code ForceConnectorConfig}s from the following
 sources (Note that sources will be checked in this order):
 <p>
 <ol>
   <li>An injected {@code ForceConnectorConfig}</li>
   <li>A named source (see {@link ForceConnectorUtils#loadConnectorPropsFromName(String)})</li>
   <li>A {@code ForceConnectorConfig} stored in the connector's {@code ThreadLocal cache</li>
 </ol>
 Connectors are capable of caching {@code ForceConnectorConfig} objects both in a {@code ThreadLocalCache}
 and an in memory cache.  The {@code ThreadLocalCache} is directly controlled by the caller.  The in memory
 cache is controlled internally by the connector.  By default, a connector will cache a {@code ForceConnectorConfig}
 in memory whenever it constructs a connection.  However, this can be turned off by the caller.
 <p>
 A {@code ForceServiceConnector} provides several additional features beyond the traditional
 Force.com API {@code Connector}.  Namely:
 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>
   Force.com connection endpoint building with automatic version binding 
   (see {@link ForceConnectorConfig#setAuthEndpoint(String)} and {@link ForceConnectorUtils#buildForceApiEndpoint(String)})
   </li>
   <li>Automatic session renewal</li>
   <li>Convenient setting of Force.com connection client identifiers (clientId)</li>
 </ul></h2>

<h2>Constructors:</h2>
<h3>public ForceServiceConnector()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Initializes a {@code ForceServiceConnector} with no {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source.
 <p>
 If using this constructor, the caller must provider a {@code ForceConnetorConfig} source
 via setters before getting a Force.com connection.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public ForceServiceConnector(String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Initializes a {@code ForceServiceConnector} with a named {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source .
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public ForceServiceConnector(ForceConnectorConfig)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Initializes a {@code ForceServiceConnector} which will use the given {@code ForceConnectorConfig}
 to get Force.com connections.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h2>Methods:</h2>
<h3>public static getThreadLocalConnectorConfig()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Retrieves the {@code ForceConnectorConfig} found in the
 {@code ForceServiceConnector} {@code ThreadLocalCache}.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public static setThreadLocalConnectorConfig(com.force.sdk.connector.ForceConnectorConfig)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the {@code ForceConnectorConfig} in the {@code ForceServiceConnector}
 {@code ThreaThreadLocale.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public getConnection()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns a Force.com API {@code PartnerConnection}.
 <p>
 This connection type can be use to make SOAP API calls to the Force.com
 service.  The {@code PartnerConnection} will be lazily constructed and
 stored in this {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s state.  This state
 can be cleared with a call to {@code close}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public getMetadataConnection()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns a Force.com API {@code MetadataConnection}.
 <p>
 This connection type can be use to make Force.com Metadata API calls to the Force.com
 service.  The {@code MetadataConnection} will be lazily constructed and
 stored in this {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s state.  This state
 can be cleared with a call to {@code close}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public getBulkConnection()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns a Force.com API {@code BulkConnection}.
 <p>
 This connection type can be use to make Force.com Bulk API calls to the Force.com
 service.  The {@code BulkConnection} will be lazily constructed and
 stored in this {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s state.  This state
 can be cleared with a call to {@code close}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public getNamespace()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns the namespace of the Force.com store to which this {@code ForceServiceConnector}
 is getting a connection.
 <p>
 A namespace uniquely identifies a Force.com store on the Force.com service.  This {@code ForceServiceConnector}
 will retrieve the namespace by getting a Force.com connection with its {@code ForceConnectorConfig} state.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public close()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Clears this {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s local state.
 <p>
 The connections gotten by a {@code ForceServiceConnector} are lazily
 constructed and stored in the {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s local state.  Thus
 multiple calls to get a connection will return the same connection object without
 re-establishing a connection to the Force.com service.  The {@code close} method
 forces this {@code ForceServiceConnector} to re-establish a connection with the 
 Force.com service by clearing its local state.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public renewSession(com.sforce.ws.ConnectorConfig)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Automatically renews Force.com timed out sessions.
 <p>
 The connections gotten by a {@code ForceServiceConnector} are lazily
 constructed and stored in the {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s local state.  Thus
 multiple calls to get a connection will return the same connection object without
 re-establishing a connection to the Force.com service.  However, this presents
 a problem should the Force.com session expire.  In that case, stored connections
 will have their session automatically renewed by the {@code renewSession}.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setClientId(java.lang.String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the Force.com connection client id.
 <p>
 The client id is a {@code String} identifier which will be set on the Force.com
 connection gotten by this {@code ForceServiceConnector}.  Note that the client
 id set here will override the client id in this {@code ForceServiceConnector}'s
 {@code ForceConnectorConfig} state.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public getConnectionName()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns the named {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source in
 this {@code ForceServiceConnector}.
 <p>
 A named {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source specifies connection
 properties in a named location.  These properties can be used to construct
 a {@code ForceConnectorConfig}.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setConnectionName(java.lang.String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the named {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source in
 this {@code ForceServiceConnector}.
 <p>
 A named {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source specifies connection
 properties in a named location.  These properties can be used to construct
 a {@code ForceConnectorConfig}.  Note that a named connection {@code ForceConnectorConfig} 
 source can be overridden by directly injecting {@code ForceConnectorConfig} state.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setConnectorConfig(com.force.sdk.connector.ForceConnectorConfig)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the {@code ForceConnectorConfig} state in this {@code ForceServiceConnector}.
 <p>
 The {@code ForceConnectorConfig} state is used by a {@code ForceServiceConnector}
 to get connections to the Force.com service.  Note that setting this state
 will override any named {@code ForceConnectorConfig} source set
 in this {@code ForceServiceConnector}.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setSkipCache(boolean)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Indicates whether or not this {@code ForceServiceConnector} should skip
 in memory {@code ForceConnectorConfig} cache reads and writes.
 <p>
 By default, a {@code ForceServiceConnector} will cache {@code ForceConnectorConfig}
 objects when getting a connection to the Force.com service.   This state allows
 the caller to control whether that cache is used or not.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setTimeout(int)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the read timeout for all Force.com connections gotten by this {@code ForceServiceConnector}.
 <p>
 Note that this timeout value will override any read timeout value set in
 a {@code ForceConnectorConfig}.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
