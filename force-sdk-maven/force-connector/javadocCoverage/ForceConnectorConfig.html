<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: A Force.com SDK wrapper for the Force.com API {@code ConnectorConfig}.
 <p>
 This wrapper stores the same state as a Force.com API {@code ConnectorConfig}
 and can itself be used for a Force.com SOAP connection.  However, it provides
 extra functionality that is useful for the Force.com SDK.  This functionality
 includes:
 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>A unique cacheId which can be used for config caching</li>
   <li>Message tracing which is subject to a log TRACE level</li>
   <li>Force.com connection URL support</li>
   <li>Automatic SOAP version binding</li>
   <li>ClientId state for conveniently setting a Force.com connection identifier</li>
 </ul></h2>

<h2>Constructors:</h2>
<h3>public ForceConnectorConfig()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Initializes a {@code ForceConnectorConfig} object which contains no
 connection properties.
 <p>
 This constructor will set the trace message flag to true which means
 that messaging tracing is controlled by setting the {@code com.force.sdk.connector}
 log level to TRACE.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h2>Methods:</h2>
<h3>public setAuthEndpoint(java.lang.String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the Force.com authentication endpoint.
 <p>
 The authEndpoint parameter may be a fully qualified, 
 versioned Force.com API endpoint.  If it is not, this
 {@code ForceConnectorConfig} will attempt to build
 a qualified Force.com API endpoint and bind the version
 to the API version used in the Force.com SDK.
 <p>

No Errors
<h3>public getClientId()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns the Force.com connection client id.
 <p>
 The client id is a {@code String} identifier which
 will be set on the Force.com connection created
 from this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setClientId(java.lang.String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the Force.com connection client id.
 <p>
 The client id is a {@code String} identifier which
 will be set on the Force.com connection created
 from this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setConnectionUrl(java.lang.String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Parses a Force.com connection URL and accordingly sets the connection
 properties found within.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setTraceMessage(boolean)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Turns on the ability for this {@code ForceConnectorConfig} to
 trace messages.
 <p>
 Ultimately, message tracing is controlled by setting the {@code com.force.sdk.connector}
 log level to TRACE. However, this granular control can be removed by setting
 the trace message flag to {@code false} here.
 <p>
 When a {@code ForceConnectorConfig} object is constructed, this flag is
 set to {@code true}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public setUsername(java.lang.String)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Sets the Force.com connection username.
 <p>
 This is overridden here because the Force.com connection
 username is used in part to generate the unique cache id
 for this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public getTraceStream()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns the {@code PrintStream} to which the
 Force.com connection will print traced API messages.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public hashCode()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Returns a hash code for this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}.
 <p>
 The hash code is computed by finding the hash code
 of this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}'s unique cacheId.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public equals(java.lang.Object)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Compares this {@code ForceConnectorConfig} to the specified object.
 <p>
 The result is {@code true} if and only if the argument 
 is not {@code null} and is a {@code ForceConnectorConfig} object
 with the same unique cacheId as this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>protected clone()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Makes a copy of this {@code ForceConnectorConfig}.
