<h1>com.force.sdk.jpa.schema.SchemaDeleteTest</h1>
<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: Test class to delete schema. Note that this test can't do any verification that force.purgeOnDeleteSchema successfully bypasses
 the recycle bin. We cover that via tests in core that test the deployOption works properly, and a unit test called
 {@link SchemaDeletionTest} that tests that the deployOption is set when we expect it to be set.</h2>
