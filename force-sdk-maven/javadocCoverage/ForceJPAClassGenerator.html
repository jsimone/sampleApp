<h1>com.force.sdk.codegen.ForceJPAClassGenerator</h1>
<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: Generator for Force.com JPA enabled Java classes.
 <p>
 This will generate a closed set of Force.com JPA enabled Java classes based on a list of
 Force.com schema object (SObject) names from a Force.com store (organization).  For example, 
 a caller wishing to generate a Java class for the Account object will get the Account Java 
 class plus the all Java classes to which the Account class will refer (i.e. the Account 
 object's references).  If the first name in the list of schema object names is a single star 
 ("*") then the generator will produce Java classes for all known objects in the Force.com
 store (organization).
 <p>
 A {@code ForceJPAClassGenerator} has a predetermined set of Force.com schema objects that
 will always be generated in addition to what is requested by the caller.</h2>
