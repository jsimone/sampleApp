<h3>public synchronized flushInternal(boolean)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>This method flushes all dirty, new, and deleted instances to the
 datastore. It has no effect if a transaction is not active. If a
 datastore transaction is active, this method synchronizes the cache with
 the datastore and reports any exceptions. If an optimistic transaction is
 active, this method obtains a datastore connection and synchronizes the
 cache with the datastore using this connection. The connection obtained
 by this method is held until the end of the transaction.

<h3>public synchronized postRollback()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>There are some cases when a postrollback tries to detach an object that has not been persisted.
 In the case of detachment the object is attempted to be reloaded which throws an NucleusObjectNotFoundException
 since the object was never stored in the db. We can ignore that exception.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public synchronized detachObject(java.lang.Object, org.datanucleus.state.FetchPlanState)</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>We add this method so that we can support detach of a newly created persistent object that has never been saved to the db.
