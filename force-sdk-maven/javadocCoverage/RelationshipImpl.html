<h1>com.force.sdk.jpa.table.RelationshipImpl</h1>
<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: Representation of a collection of related objects on a Force.com object.
 If Object A has a lookup field to Object B and B thus has a collection of 
 Object As, the collection is not actually represented as a field in Force.com,
 but rather the lookup to B implies the collection. Because of this we need
 to be able to differentiate between these types of columns.</h2>
