<h1>com.force.sdk.oauth.AuthFilterCookieManagementTest</h1>
<h2>Policy: default</h2>
<h2>Comment Text: This class tests the session management of the AuthFilter.
 All tests assume that a user has already authenticated via OAuth
 so this state is initialized ahead of time. With each test we are
 simulating whether you have a session with your security context
 on the server you hit or not. Also whether the data in that security
 context may be stale.</h2>

<h3>public testValidSessionData()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>User is authenticated and they visit an instance that has
 their java session.
 
 Here we set up a request that has the sfdc sid and endpoint cookies.
 A security context is also put into the session. We test that the
 context in the session at the end is the same as what we started with.
 there should be no call to the partner api.

<h3>public testInvalidSFDCSessionId()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>User is authenticated and they visit an instance that has
 their java session, but the sfdc session id in the Security 
 Context doesn't match the one in their cookie (stale data).
 
 Here we set up a request that has the sfdc sid and endpoint cookies.
 A security context is also put into the session, but it has a different
 session id in it. This simulates stale data in the session. We test that the
 context in the session at the end came from the partner api because we expect
 a call to refresh the data.

No Errors
<h3>public testNoDataInSession()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>User is authenticated and they visit an instance that does
 not have their Java session.
 
 Here we set up a request that has the sfdc sid and endpoint cookies.
 No security context is put into the session to simulate hitting an instance that 
 you don't have a session with. We test that the context in the session at the 
 end came from the partner api because we expect a call to get the data.
Issues: <br/>
No Errors
<h3>public testNoDataInSessionLocalhost()</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>Same as testNoDataInSession, but we'll use localhost here to verify that the cookies
 are not set as secure.
