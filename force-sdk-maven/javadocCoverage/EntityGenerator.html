<h2>Comment Text: This class generates some basic entities for subquery tests. It can be repurposed if it's useful
 for other tests.</h2>

<h2>Methods:</h2>
<h3>public static main(java.lang.String[])</h3>
Comment Text: <br/>current arguments are:
 args[0] - the path to the folder where the entities should be created
 args[1] - the number of entities to create
 
 This test creates:
 Entity0 - name and id fields, OneToMany collections for every subsequent entity
 EntityN where N > 1 - name and id fields, lookup field to Entity0,
                       lookup field to Entity(N-1), and OneToMany collection for Entity(N+1)
 All OneToMany's use the lazy fetch type with the exception of the very last entity created.
 
 If you want to add more than 26 entities this file will need to be adjusted slightly,
 as you cannot have more than 25 child relationships
